# Graph Learning - Practical Works

This repository contains practical works completed during the SD212 - Graph Learning course at Télécom Paris.

## Course Description

SD212 focuses on the main properties of real graphs and key algorithms for sampling, ranking, classifying, representing, and clustering nodes. The course covers the structure of real graphs, with emphasis on scale-free and small-world properties. It also teaches methods to identify important nodes, detect node clusters, classify nodes, and predict new links.

## Objectives

The main objective is to enable students to identify graph structures in data and apply appropriate techniques for various learning tasks, including prediction, ranking, and clustering.

## Practical Works

This repository includes the following practical works:

1. Sparse matrices
2. Graph structure
3. PageRank
4. Hierarchy Clustering
5. Hierarchical clustering
6. Heat diffusion
7. Spectral embedding
8. Graph neural networks

## Key Topics

- Graphs
- Sparse matrices
- Ranking
- Clustering
- Embedding
- Graph neural networks

## Programming

A significant portion of the course involves programming in Python, implementing and testing various algorithms for analyzing real datasets.
